# Data Model

The ApiNATOMY data model is a JSON file that matches the [ApiNATOMY JSON Schema](schema/index.html). The schema provides a contract between the input data and the lyph viewer component. In the nutshell, the input model is an object that 
 contains sets of entities which are either 
 nodes, links, lyphs, materials or groups which contain subsets of these entities. 
 Properties of these objects reflect the meaning and parameters of the associated physiological elements (connections, processes or tissue composition) as well as provide positioning constraints that help us to assemble them into structurally correct models of physiology. 
 
 In the rest of this manual, we explain, using small examples, how ApiNATOMY data model definitions render into graphical elements displayed by the lyph viewer.
