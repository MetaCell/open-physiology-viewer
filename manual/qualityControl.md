# Model quality control

## Discovering closed sub-systems
The viewer automatically analyzes an input model and creates dynamic groups with closed flow, i.e., 
sub-graphs topologically equivalent to a cyst. Such components are important and may represent anatomically meaningful 
systems such as neurons and neuron parts. The algorithm places discovered groups under the title `Dynamic groups`.
