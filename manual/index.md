# ApiNATOMY User Guide
 Physiology deals with the body in terms of anatomical compartments that delineate portions of  interest. The compartments can be defined at various anatomical scales, from organs to cells. Clinical and bioengineering experts are interested to see records of physical measurements  associated with certain anatomical compartments.  

_ApiNATOMY_ is a methodology to coherently manage knowledge about the scale, parthood and connectivity of anatomical compartments as well as to represent and analyse process mechanisms and associated measurements. It consists of
* a knowledge model about biophysical entities, and   
* a method to build knowledge representations of physiology processes in terms of  biophysical entities and physical operations over these entities.

The following [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unSw6VcIOHw) explains the ideas underlying the ApiNATOMY methodology:

The current project delivers a graphical tool, called ApiNATOMY lyph viewer,  that automatically creates a biologically meaningful visualizations of ApiNATOMY models as part of the [NIH-SPARC](https://commonfund.nih.gov/sparc) [MAP-CORE](https://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=9538432) toolset.

In this manual, we overview the aforementioned software application. Installation instructions and control  settings are explained in the [usage](./manual/usage.html) guide. An important aspect of the project, the input format for specifying ApiNATOMY data models, is explained in the data [model](./manual/model.html) guide. Examples of the physiology models designed by a domain expert and converted to our input format are shown in the [example](./manual/examples.html) section.

Note that despite our best effort to keep this document up-to-date, it may differ from the actual implementation of the lyph viewer. The underlying modelling concepts evolve to suit the needs of the growing group of adopters of the ApiNATOMY methodology within the biomedical community.
