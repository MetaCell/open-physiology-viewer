# ApiNATOMY User Guide
 Physiology deals with the body in terms of anatomical compartments that delineate portions of  interest. The compartments can be defined at various anatomical scales, from organs to cells. Clinical and bioengineering experts are interested to see records of physical measurements  associated with certain anatomical compartments.  

[_ApiNATOMY_](http://open-physiology.org/apinatomy-toolkit/index.html) is a methodology to coherently manage knowledge about the scale, parthood and connectivity of anatomical compartments as well as to represent and analyse process mechanisms and associated measurements. It consists of   
* a knowledge model about biophysical entities, and   
* a method to build knowledge representations of physiology processes in terms of  biophysical entities and physical operations over these entities.

The current project delivers a graphical component, called, ApiNATOMY lyph viewer,  that automatically creates a biologically meaningful WebGL-based visualization of ApiNATOMY models as part of the [NIH-SPARC](https://commonfund.nih.gov/sparc) [MAP-CORE](https://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=9538432) toolset.

In the rest of this manual, we overview the aforementioned component in more detail.
An important aspect of the project, the input format for specifying ApiNATOMY data models, is explained in the data model guide. Installation instructions and control  settings are explained in the usage guide.
