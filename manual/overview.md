The ApiNATOMY lyph viewer shows 3d schematics of physiology models.
The lyph viewer is a graphical component that consists of

* a canvas that features a dynamic graph rendered using a force-directed layout algorithm;
* a control panel that allows users to change parameters of the viewer and select parts of the model to display.
 
The use of the ApiNATOMY lyph viewer component is illustrated via the test application that allows the user to load an ApiNATOMY data model from the local file system. In addition to the aforementioned component, the demo application includes:
 
* a header and a footer with relevant project information, 
* a toolbar that allows the user to import, edit, preview and export the data model,
* the integrated JSON editor to overview, analyze and modify the chosen data model.  

Sample ApiNATOMY models, including test models used in this documentation, can be found in the project's [repository at GitHub](https://github.com/open-physiology/open-physiology-viewer/tree/master/test/data).
